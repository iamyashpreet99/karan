IMPORTANT: Which file to open?

You need to open: index.html
NOT: cricket-game.html (this is the old file)

The new game is in index.html with these files:
- index.html (main file - OPEN THIS ONE!)
- styles.css
- gameData.js
- gameEngine.js
- renderer.js
- main.js

To run:
1. Double-click index.html, OR
2. Use start-game.bat, OR
3. Run: npx http-server -p 8000 -o

If teams don't show:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for errors
3. Make sure all .js files are in the same folder as index.html
4. Try refreshing the page
